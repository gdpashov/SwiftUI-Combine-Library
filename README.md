## App Structure

1. `API`/`APIService`

> Uses Combine

Creates a publisher that requests an API service, validates the response, and decodes the result JSON data into a specified object.

Returns `AnyPublisher<T, Error>` where:

- `T` is either `Data` to return the raw data or `Defined Type` to apply JSON transformation to the returned data. The object models of the returned Open Library JSON data are specified in `Models`/`OpenLibrarySearchResult`.

- `Error`Â is the error that may arise during execution.

2. `ViewModels`/`APIRequestViewModel`
